## Earth Engine Landsat Collection Builder (EE-LCB)

A convenience library for the Google Earth Engine JavaScript API that builds a Landsat
collection foundation to support your science. Our goal is to establish best practices
for building Landsat collections and shortcut users to analyses. We believe that we 
need to move past everyone writing essentially the same pre-processing scripts 100 
different ways before finally doing some analyses. Let's get to the good stuff already 
and utilize EE for furthering our understanding of the Earth ecosystem.
