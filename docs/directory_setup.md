# Directory Setup

There are three major directories that are required for the process of generating annual change polygons: 

- A programming environment directory
- A script directory
- A project directory

The three directories could be created in a single parent folder or spread out among paths that make sense 
for your system (more on this in the following steps). For the purpose of this guide, all three 
directories will be under a parent folder called **LandTrendrGEE** directly on the C drive.

If you have write privilege to the C drive, create a folder at this location: **C:\LandTrendrGEE**, if 
you don’t have write permission to this directory, choose a different location.

You should now have a **LandTrendrGEE folder** somewhere on your computer. In the next few steps we’ll 
add the three major directories to it, making it look something like this:

```
C:\LandTrendrGEE
├───LandTrendrPyEnv
├───LT-ChangeDB
└───projects
```

This directory will be referenced frequently throughout the guide.
